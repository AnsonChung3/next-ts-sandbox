# About this sandbox

- This is a Next.js project, written in Typescript, with added Mongodb.
- The plan for this sandbox is to make a simple battle simulator
    - write the project in TS
    - use Mongodb to store player create characters
    - use Next.js for a backend and handle (if any) fetch request
    - React for desktop browser UI
- The plan may change at any stage 😂 since this is a sandbox/learning project

## To run dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
